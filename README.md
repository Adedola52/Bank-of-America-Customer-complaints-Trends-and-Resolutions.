**ABOUT THE DATASET**

The dataset was obtained from Maven Analytics and contains 7 years of customer complaints records. It includes 62.52k rows and 12 columns, providing detailed information to help analyze trends and patterns in customer complaints.

**CREATING A DATE TABLE**

Creating a Date Table using DAX in Power BI is essential for time-based analyses, as it ensures seamless functionality of time-based slicers and filters, it  enables advanced time intelligence calculations like Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD), and improves report performance compared to relying on raw date columns. It also acts as a central link between date columns in multiple tables, ensuring consistent relationships and accurate results.

**DATA MODELING**

A relationship was established between the complaints table and the date table to ensure seamless analysis, allowing efficient filtering and accurate time-based insights across the dataset.
