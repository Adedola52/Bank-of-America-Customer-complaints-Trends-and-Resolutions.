**ABOUT THE DATASET**

The dataset was obtained from Maven Analytics and contains 7 years of customer complaints records. It includes 62.52k rows and 12 columns, providing detailed information to help analyze trends and patterns in customer complaints.

**CREATING A DATE TABLE**

Creating a Date Table using DAX in Power BI is essential for time-based analyses, as it ensures seamless functionality of time-based slicers and filters, it  enables advanced time intelligence calculations like Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD), and improves report performance compared to relying on raw date columns. It also acts as a central link between date columns in multiple tables, ensuring consistent relationships and accurate results.

**DATA MODELING**

A relationship was established between the complaints table and the date table to ensure seamless analysis, allowing efficient filtering and accurate time-based insights across the dataset.

**Key Metrics**

- **Product:** Overall number of products identified in consumer complaints.
- **Sub-Product:** Total number of sub-products identified in consumer complaints.
- **Issue:** Total number of issues consumers identified in their complaints.
- **Sub-Issue:** Total number of sub-issues identified by consumers in their complaints.
- **Complaints:** Overall complaints received by Bank of America from consumers between May 2017 - Aug 2023.

**Key Insights:**

- **Consistency across years:** There was a notable consistency in top complaint products and issues across years, with some shifts in response patterns and complaint channels in 2023.

- **Regional Concentration:** The dominance of California, Florida, and Texas in complaints highlights potential regional issues in handling financial products.

- **Platform Shifts:** An increased preference for phone communication in 2023 over referral suggests evolving customer communication preferences, especially during periods of heightened complaint activity.

- **Product-Specific Issues:** Each product category had unique issues and resolution trends, reflecting the diverse challenges faced by consumers in managing financial products.
_____
**Recommendations:**
  
1. **Enhanced Customer Support and Resolution Processes:**
   
- **Shift towards Real-time Support:** Increase investments in real-time customer support systems, especially via phone channels, to manage complaints more efficiently. The rise in “In-progress” complaints in 2023 suggests that customers prefer direct communication channels for resolving issues. 
- **Improve Online and Mobile Platforms:** Maintain and improve the user interface of web and mobile platforms to make complaint filing and resolution easier. Simplify the process of tracking complaint status and ensure clear communication about next steps.
- **Automated Systems for Common Complaints:** Implement automated systems for handling common issues such as incorrect information on reports, account management issues, and payment disputes. This can expedite resolutions and reduce the workload on customer service representatives.
  
2. **Proactive Customer Education:**

- **Enhance Consumer Awareness:** Develop educational resources to inform consumers about their rights and the complaint process. This can include guides on managing credit reports, understanding bank statements, and resolving issues directly with financial service providers.
- **Provide Training:** Offer training for customer service staff to handle complaints more effectively, particularly for issues such as fraud prevention and managing loan payments. This will help in reducing the volume of complaints and improving customer satisfaction.

3. **Geographical Targeting of Services:**

- **Address Regional Challenges:** Given the concentration of complaints in states like California, Florida, and Texas, companies should consider tailoring their services to meet regional challenges. This might involve specific customer outreach efforts, localized complaint resolution protocols, or partnerships with regional agencies.
- **Data-Driven Strategies:** Use data analytics to identify regional trends and problem areas. Adjust marketing strategies and customer service efforts to address these challenges proactively.

4. **Crisis Management:**

- **Preparedness for Crisis Situations:** Companies should develop crisis management plans that include rapid response mechanisms to manage spikes in complaints, especially during periods of economic uncertainty or new regulatory changes. This will help maintain customer trust and prevent widespread dissatisfaction.

5. **Monitoring and Feedback Mechanisms:**

- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly monitor complaint patterns and feedback from customers. Use this data to make informed improvements in products and services. Implement customer feedback loops that allow consumers to suggest improvements and track how their feedback influences changes in service delivery.
- **Regular Audits and Reviews:** Conduct periodic reviews of the complaint management process and resolution strategies to identify areas for improvement. Regular audits can uncover recurring issues and prevent future problems.
